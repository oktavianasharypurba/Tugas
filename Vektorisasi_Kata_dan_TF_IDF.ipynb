Cle. \"  \\n  \\nI knew that, it wasn\\'t the best song l ever wrote, but I didn\\'t  \\nHave time to change it. I was comin\\' down mighty fast.  \\n  \\nBut as you all know, and as fate would have it, I didn\\'t die. I  \\nLanded on the top of a police car. And he died. I drove away  \\nOn the road that he was on. I came into town at a screamin\\'  \\n175 miles an hour, playin\\' the motorcycle song.  \\n  \\nI came into town, I jumped off my bike, the bike went around  \\nThe corner by itself, went up on the stand by itself, turned  \\nItself off.  \\n  \\nI walked over to my friend. He was standin\\' there eatin\\'  \\nPickles. I said \"Hi, what\\'s happenin\\'?\" He looked at me in the  \\nEye and said \"Nothin\\'\".  \\n  \\nYou gotta sing it with that kind of enthusiasm. Like you just  \\nSquashed a cop...  \\n  \\nChorus\\n\\n',\n",
